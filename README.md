# Deep Learning project S23: Rice image classification 
## Description 
An image classification where we predict a label We used Three types of model:
### A convolutional Neural Network Model, using Pytorch Framework
A deep learning model, we aim to achieve a thorough understanding of the model's performance subtleties, as well as remarkable classification accuracy.
### An SVM model, 
A machine learning model, 
### A K-nearest Neighbors model,
A machine learning model,

# Background and Data

For this image classification, we used a rice types images dataset from Kaggle, which is the following : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/muratkokludataset/rice-image-dataset

It contains 75 000 color images (RGB color space -Red, Green and Blue-) with 5 classes (rice types), each class contains 15 000 images. 
To explore this project, please verify you are working on a GPU device for afaster training and better performance. The evaluation part can be done on CPU.

# Usage

Insert unseen images, in this case a rice image, and get a prediction of it label. The project is submitted as a Jupyter notebook which includes Data preprocessing, building a model, model training and evaluation, as well as some visualization. Based on the accuracy of each model, we deduced that the best model is CNN model, which is a Deep Learning model.

# Explanation of some codes

for each model, we worked with different Framework. for CNN model, we used the Pytorch Framework. Since it is the case, the preprocessing part is different, where it needs to follow each Framework as well as the type of model used.
